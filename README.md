# Odinbar
This is a fullstack social media app project where I replicated the core functionality of the Facebook and built with Ruby and Rails.
Live demo [_here_](https://obscure-citadel-89619.herokuapp.com).

## General Information
It's the one of the hardest projects I ever built so far. I learned a lot along the way, and spend quality time thinking about the database, with pen and paper on my hand before initializing this project. Most challenging part was probably setting up the friendship model between users. I really enjoyed tackling the surprising challenges while developing this app.
