# Project Plans

I'll add the plans of the project.


1. ✅ PostgreSQL for database
2. ✅ Users should sign in to see anything except the sign in page.
3. ✅ User sign-in will use the Devise gem for security.
4. ✅ Users can send Friend Requests to other Users.
5. ✅ A User has to accept the Friend Request to become friends.
6. The Friend Request shows up in the notifications section of a User’s navbar.
7. Users can create Posts (text only to start).
8. Users can Like Posts.
9. Users can Comment on Posts.
10. Posts will display the post content, author, comments and likes.
11. Posts Index page, like the real “Timeline” feature – all the recent posts from the current user and users he/she is friends with.
12. Users can create a Profile with their personal information and a photo.
13. The User Show page with their Profile information, photo, and Posts.
14. The Users Index page lists all users and buttons for sending Friend Requests to those who are not already friends or who don’t already have a pending request.
15. Sign in will use OmniAuth  to sign in with google.
16. Mailer will be used to send a welcome email when a new user signs up.
